# Disease-Classification-CNN

This is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for accurate and efficient classification of medical images into four categories: Monkeypox, Chickenpox, Measles, and Normal. This repository contains the implementation of the CNN model, along with the necessary data preprocessing and evaluation scripts. The model has been trained on a decently big dataset of annotated medical images to provide reliable disease classification results. Researchers and healthcare professionals can utilize this repository to enhance disease diagnosis, surveillance, and monitoring efforts.
